# Climate Change Impact on Agriculture: Crop Yield Prediction

This project aims to predict the impact of climate change on agriculture by forecasting crop yields based on key climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and soil health. The goal is to provide an accurate prediction of crop yield to help stakeholders in agriculture make better, data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

Climate change significantly affects agricultural production by influencing temperature, rainfall, and soil health. This project uses machine learning to develop a **Linear Regression** model that predicts crop yield based on historical climate and agricultural data. The solution is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive platform for users to upload data and receive real-time predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the relationship between climatic factors (temperature, rainfall, soil health) and crop yield.
- **Predictive Model**: Uses a **Linear Regression** model to predict crop yield based on climate data.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Interactive web interface to visualize the data and make predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visualizations like scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and bar charts to better understand data trends.
